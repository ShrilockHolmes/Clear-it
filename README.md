# Clear-it
It is a simple, automatic chrome/chromium history remover . It exists for those who don't use Brave or other browsers with the autoclear functionality 
<p>It currently just uses chrome api to clear all history and does not choose or ask for a date from which to clear history 
<br> it runs a script on startup of chrome and deletes history, this does not run during close so as even if the pc crashes it functions
  <h2>#Why</h2>
  this is because the other such plugin is paid and asks for 14$ as subscription for a simple program </p>
